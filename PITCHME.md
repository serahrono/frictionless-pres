# Frictionless Data, Frictionless Development

---

# What is data management about?

![Cloudstuff](cloud.jpeg)

---

# How do we address these problems?

* Tools
* Standards
* (Processes)

---

* What stakeholders do our tools and standards need to cater for?

pic - BI people, data generators (e.g. lab scientists, logistics people, data curators) data scientists, academics
But also the even less technical people:
HR people, Marketing people

---

* How should our tools be architected?

vendor platforms vs microservices vs mvp tools that do one things well vs sacrificing accesability for flexibility vs setting
up academic comittees to devise a long boring and unusable standard

* Frictionless data aims to bridge these disperate fields to provide cross-platform ways of describing and using datasets
* When a bespoke tool is needed, frictionless data provides some great building blocks across the stack to help with
* import, validation, processing, export and display
* When you are struggling with a data model for a task or a schema, frictionless data's standards provide guidance

# But NumPy and Pandas have data schemata which can be exported via the datashape project
---

# You can interpolate all these data formats using odo 
# You can view things in my jupyter dashboard or via the rosetta install
# install

:confused: Scientists in data-immature disciplines
:confused: Data curators
:confused: HR, Marketing etc

# Enterprise architecture didn't just go away because we invented the data science buzzword. If we like to say data is
# everywhere let's help all the stakholders...

---
# OK, enough chat, let's build an end-to-end tool using frictionless data
